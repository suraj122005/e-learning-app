Back-end ⚙️
The back-end of the platform is built using NodeJS and ExpressJS, providing APIs for the front-end to consume. These APIs include functionalities such as user authentication, course creation, and course consumption. The back-end also handles the logic for processing and storing the course content and user data.

Back-end Features
User Authentication and Authorization 🔐: Students and instructors can sign up and log in to the platform using their email addresses and passwords. The platform also supports OTP (One-Time Password) verification and forgot password functionality for added security.

Course Management 🛠️: Instructors can create, read, update, and delete courses, as well as manage course content and media. Students can view and rate courses.

Payment Integration 💳: Students will purchase and enroll in courses by completing the checkout flow, followed by Razorpay integration for payment handling.

Cloud-based Media Management ☁️ : StudyNotion uses Cloudinary, a cloud-based media management service, to store and manage all media content, including images, videos, and documents.

Markdown Formatting ✍️: Course content in document format is stored in Markdown format, allowing for easier display and rendering on the front-end.
Data Models and Database Schema

The back-end of StudyNotion uses several data models and database schemas to manage data, including:

Student Schema 🧑‍🎓: Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each student.

Instructor Schema 👩‍🏫: Includes fields such as name, email, password, and course details for each instructor.

Course Schema 📚: Includes fields such as course name, description, instructor details, and media content.

Database 🛢️
The database for the platform is built using MongoDB, a NoSQL database that provides a flexible and scalable data storage solution. MongoDB allows for the storage of unstructured and semi-structured data. The database stores the course content, user data, and other relevant information related to the platform.
